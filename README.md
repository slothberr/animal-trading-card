# Animal Trading Cards
This is the second project for the Udacity Google Challenge Scholarship for Front-End Web Development. For this project, we had to use our knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a web-based trading card depicting our favorite animal. I decided to choose one of my most favorite fictional animals, Waddles, from the TV show "Gravity Falls".

## Project Features
The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
* Italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* Bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
* No dots for the animal's list items
* Border around the animal's name, image, and information
* Border around the animal's information
* Spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
